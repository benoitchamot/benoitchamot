## Call me Benny

### ðŸ‘¯ What do I bring?
- Proficiency with Python, SQL and MongoDB (read more below!)
- **10+ years of experience** in the space industry
- Engineer = scientific mind and **problem-solver**
- Business developer = communication and **relationship building**

### âš¡ Fun Facts
- I'm definitely a **Python** guy (I have used it since about 2012 for all kind of stuff)
- I have built websites since 2004 or so and HTML was my first introduction to programming) - I mostly did static stuff but I'm Javascript-curious.
- My formal training involved programming embedded systems (robots, satellites, ...) in C. I haven't done this in a long while and I miss it. I'm interested in getting back into systems languages, including Zig.
- I know my way around a database.

### ðŸŒ± Current Side Quests
Recently, I have been looking into Neovim (btw) and Lua as a way to better understand and master the tools I use. In an ideal world I would never touch VS Code again but I don't hate it.
