## Hi there, I am Benoit

### What do I bring?
- Proficiency with Python, SQL and MongoDB (read more below!)
- **10+ years of experience** in the space industry
- Engineer = scientific mind and **problem-solver**
- Business developer = communication and **relationship building**

### Programming skills
- **Python** (I have used it since about 2012 for data cleaning and mining) - some modules I am particularly familiar with are pandas, matplotlib, scipy, Flask, pymongo and SQLAlchemy... The projects I have worked on includes space mission design (as part of my work), web scraping, data analytics, neural networks, simple game design (text-based and 2D), etc.
- **HTML5** and **JavaScript** (I have built websites since 2004 or so and HTML was my first introduction to programming) - I enjoy building interactive dashboard with HTML5, based on a Bootstrap structure and including Plotly.js, Leaflet.js, D3.js and AnyChart.js. I am planning to explore more of what JavaScript has to offer.
- **MongoDB**, **SQLite** and **Postgres** (I have used NoSQL and SQL databases in many projects) - I like the flexibility of MongoDB but I usually rely on SQLite for small projects. I have experience with Google **BigQuery&** too.
- **Excel** (I have built extensive dashboards in Excel during my career to report on sales activities and prepare forecast for production teams) - I usually start all my projects with some quick prototyping in Excel before moving to Python
- **R** (I have started using this language only recently and I am still exploring its potential) - I love learning new programming languages and adding them to my skillset.

### Monash University's Data Analytics Bootcamp
This intensive program goes into a lot of details and is built around practical assignments and projects (many of which can be found in my repositories.) It helped me update my programming skills, especially in Python, and formalise over a decade of self-learning about data manipulation and numerical analysis.

### Google Data Analytics Specialization
Graduated in Sept. 2023

This course started my journey as a Data Analyst and gave me an overview of the complete Data Analytics process.
